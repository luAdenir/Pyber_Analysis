It is also notable that rural cities has the lowest number of drivers of 78 compare to suburban which has 490 and urban cities with 2,405 total of drivers. With the highest total rides and drivers, it makes urban cities with the highest total fares of $39,854.38, followed by suburban cities with $19356.33 and rural cities with $4,327.93.

This multiple line chart shows the trend of the total fares by city type from January to April 2019. This analysis already demonstrates that urban cities has the highest total fares. But in this chart, it is interesting to see that the three types of city show similar peak sometime in February. 

## **Summary**

Technological infrastructure is one of the challenges in some areas like rural cities. Ridesharing apps depend on a good cell services. And not all americans use debit, credit cards and payment apps. These are few of the obstacles for ridesharing. Improving cell services, call center where people who are not smart phone/app users can call for a ride and introducing alternatives to debit/credit cards, like cash or subcription and reloadable cards will help promote ridesharing in areas with less customers.
